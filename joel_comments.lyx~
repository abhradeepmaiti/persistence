Comments on Joel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Loved the paper.
 Just a few things on the first half.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\begin_layout Standard
Medieval science way more advanced and dynamic than you credit.
 Remember, the Aristotelian physics of the fourteenth century is not the
 physics of Aristotle.
 In terms of physics, the quarrel of ancients and moderns had been sorted
 out pretty definitively by 1400.
 Naturally Galileo represented these guys as Neanderthals to push the novelty
 of his own stuff but it is far from true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few really good books on this.

\begin_layout Itemize
God's Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern
 Science by James Hannam is popular but first rate.

\begin_layout Itemize
The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Instituti
onal and Intellectual Contexts (Cambridge Studies in the History of Science)
 by Edward Grant is the standard academic account.

\begin_layout Itemize
A really fascinating account, from an economist's perspective, is Economy
 and Nature in the Fourteenth Century: Money, Market Exchange, and the Emergence
 of Scientific Thought by Joel (!) Kaye.
 He argues that the new dynamic philosophy, centred especially in Merton,
 was the outcome of a rapidly monetizing economy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Naturally, none of this affects your argument: it just shows that things
 go back a long way further than your are implying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Page 8, fn6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tycho Brahe's claim that the nova showed no parallax and therefore must
 have been in the super-lunary sphere was savagely contested at the time.
 What is most interesting about the debate is that, instead of the customary
 logic chopping, it focussed exclusively on the accuracy of the instruments
 involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Page 9â€“13.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember that a big demand for astronomers and mathematicians, in Protestant
 places, was for astrology.
 We have a little bit on this in the instruments paper.
 Again an example of a huge and dynamic branch of knowledge that led nowhere
 in itself but contributed vastly to the development of stuff that did.

\begin_layout Standard
The phlogiston stuff does not tie in neatly with the rest of the argument
 here.

\begin_layout Standard
I am uneasy with the European war was good orthodoxy.
 You just need to look at how south Germany, one of the most economically
 and scientifically advanced areas of Europe, and the centre of instrument
 making in Europe, was smashed to pieces in the 30 Years War.
 Did Europe succeed because or despite its incessant fighting?

\begin_layout Standard
Jesuits could not impose will north of the Alps? They dominated France,
 notably its education system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am not entirely convinced by Alexander.
 Remember that there are two approaches to calculus.
 We are most familiar with lim(x+h)/h which is basically designed to confuse
 school kids.
 Far easier and without getting into questions of infinitesimals is the
 differential approach where dx is the change in Bill Gates' wealth if you
 give him a cent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think you need to be specific about which philosophers were able to move
 to more convivial places.
